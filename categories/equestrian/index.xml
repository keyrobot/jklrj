      <description>&lt;p&gt;Equestrian sports, celebrated for their elegance, strength, and the unique partnership between horse and rider, are beloved by many across the world.

According to the American Medical Equestrian Association, approximately 20% of equestrians will suffer a serious injury at some point in their riding careers. Whether it’s a fall from a horse, being kicked, or even an accident during competition, the risks are real and can lead to costly medical bills, property damage, or even long-term disability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
